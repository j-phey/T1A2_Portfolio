### Functionality / Features
#### Home page
The **Home** page is the first screen that users will see when visiting my portfolio website. For consistency, several elements of this page are mainstays of my website as users navigate to other pages.

From top to bottom: 
- It first features a custom made logo, that also acts as a button that users can click or tap to navigate back to the Home page.
- The navigation bar anchors to the top of every page so that users can jump around the website with ease.
- The main content features a photo and quick intro of myself. This is kept brief to keep the user's attention and can be customised easily and built upon in the future.
- The social logos / links at the bottom are purposefully 

#### Blog page

The **Blog** page features all of the titles of my blogs and the date stamp of when they were published in descending order. The blogs will act as a place to share my thoughts and learning journey.

For readability on mobile devices, I researched and implemented a way through CSS to make each blog post show a preview of the first few lines of the post, followed by a `Read more` link as a call-to-action for the user.

#### Blog page > Blog posts

Each blog post features the title, a date stamp, a relevant image and the content.

#### Experience page

The **Experience** page features two columns that briefly highlight my education and work experience. The two columns are built so that they will stack on top of each other when on mobile devices. 

It features unordered lists/bullet points for readability and indentation for sub-bullets, which I had to manually push out. Also, I added the companyâ€™s logos next to the work experience to add a simple, but effective, visual element for users to quickly recognise my previous employers.

At the bottom is a button that links out to my full resume - '`Click for my full resume`' The button features a change of colour on hover, as well as an active change when clicked or tapped on for a true button effect.

#### About Me page

The **About Me** page shares a bit more about myself, including a quick bio, my hobbies and interests.

It features a photo of myself (similar style to the home page photo for consistency). There are three main sections in a single column for readability and to clearly separate the purpose of each section. Each section features a heading, a couple of sentences and a few emoji to summarise the content in a visual way.

### Sitemap

The starting page when visiting my website is **Home**, which branches out to the other pages. 

Users can always navigate to **Home**, **Blog**, **Experience** and **About Me** through the navigation bar. Also, **Home** is accessible through the logo at the top.
