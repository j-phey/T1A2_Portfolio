## Portfolio Website

### Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase the web development skills that I have learnt in my first two weeks at Coder Academy. Also, it will show the user a bit more about me, my experience and give them a way to contact me.

### Functionality / Features
#### Home page
The **Home** page is the first screen that users will see when visiting my portfolio website. For consistency, several elements of this page are mainstays of my website as users navigate to other pages.

From top to bottom: 
- It first features a custom made logo, that also acts as a button that users can click or tap to navigate back to the Home page.
- The navigation bar anchors to the top of every page so that users can jump around the website with ease.
- The main content features a photo and quick intro of myself. This is kept brief to keep the user's attention and can be customised easily and built upon in the future.
- The social logos / links at the bottom are purposefully
